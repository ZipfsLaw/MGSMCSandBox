# Realistic Weapon Descriptions for MGS3
A small experimental .ASI plugin that replaces the in-game weapon descriptions with more realistic information.

## Installation
- This mod requires Version 1.3.0 for MGS3.
- Download the latest version of [MGSHDFix](https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidmastercollection/mods/65).

## Disclaimer
- This mod is experimental and is still a work-in-progress.
- First release only supports English. I'm looking into supporting other languages as well.
- It is highly recommended to back up game saves and files!
- Please report any issues, bugs, and crashes!
